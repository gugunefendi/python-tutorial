# Expression
# Expression is a combination from value, variable, operator or function that evaluated to be a single value.

# Arithmetic Conversions
# Pyhton automatically convert a numeric value to make sure operation runs correctly

# If either argument is a complex number, the other is converted to complex
x = 3 + 4j + 2 # 
print(x) # Output: (5+4j)

# if either argument is a floating-point number, the other is converted to float point
y = 1.2 + 2
print(y) # Output: 3.2

# if all numbers is intger. no one to convert
z = 3 + 5
print(z) # Output: 8
